Triangular meshes[^1] stand as a cornerstone in computer graphics, essential in
the portrayal and animation of 3D objects. A critical aspect of processing
these meshes involves extracting **Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB)**[^2].

## Problem to Solve

Triangular meshes, particularly when it comes to intricate surface detailing,
can be both complex and computationally intensive. Operations on these meshes
often demand significant resources. Having a precise oriented bounding box aids
in simplifying many computational geometry problems related to surface meshes,
like collision detection, mesh simplification, and many more. However,
generating an optimal OBB for surface meshes is a non-trivial task. OrientMesh
aims to offer a reliable, optimized, and easily-integrable solution for this
challenge.

## Prospective Users

_**OrientMesh Toolkit**_ targets game developers, computer science students,
researchers, and professionals working with 3D models, especially in areas
requiring accurate bounding boxes like game development, simulation, and
augmented reality.

## System Architecture

_**OrientMesh Toolkit**_ utilizes C++ for its core computational tasks,
ensuring performance optimization. Moreover, Python is employed for its
bindings, making it seamlessly usable for a wider audience and also aiding
in GUI development and design.

**Components**:

- **Triangular Mesh Data Structures (C++)**: This component serves as the
  foundation, hosting the mesh structures essential for subsequent operations.
- **Algorithm for Optimal OBB Extraction (C++)**: A dedicated component that
  undertakes the crucial task of extracting the Oriented Bounding Boxes from
  the meshes.
- **API (C++ and Python)**: Interface that facilitates seamless communication
  between different modules and allows extensibility for future needs.
- **Python Bindings Using `pybind11`**: This bridges the gap between C++
  computations and Python's versatility, opening up the toolkit for a wider
  user base.
- **Interactive GUI (Python `PyQt`)**: A visual platform enabling users to
  visualize the mesh and extracted OBB interactively.

**Mesh data structure**:

```cpp
class Mesh {
public:
    // Default constructor
    Mesh(); 
    // Copy constructor                             
    Mesh(const Mesh& mesh);                   

    // Read mesh from file
    bool read(const std::string& fileName);  
    // Write mesh to file
    bool write(const std::string& fileName);  

    // Mesh components
    std::vector<HalfEdge> halfEdges;          // Collection of HalfEdges
    std::vector<Vertex> vertices;             // Vertex list
    std::vector<Eigen::Vector3d> uvs;         // UV coordinates for texturing
    std::vector<Eigen::Vector3d> normals;     // Vertex normals
    std::vector<Edge> edges;                  // Edge list
    std::vector<Face> faces;                  // Face list
    std::vector<HalfEdgeIter> boundaries;     // Boundary HalfEdges for open meshes
};
```

**BoundingBox data structure**:
```cpp
class BoundingBox {
public:
    // Default constructor
    BoundingBox();

    // Constructor initializing with specified min and max components
    BoundingBox(const Eigen::Vector3d& min0, const Eigen::Vector3d& max0);

    // Constructor initializing with a single point
    BoundingBox(const Eigen::Vector3d& p);

    // Destructor
    virtual ~BoundingBox(){};

    // Expand bounding box to include a point
    void expandToInclude(const Eigen::Vector3d& p);

    // Expand bounding box to include another bounding box
    void expandToInclude(const BoundingBox& b);

    // Return the maximum dimension of the bounding box
    int maxDimension() const;

    // Check if this bounding box contains another bounding box and calculate the distance
    bool contains(const BoundingBox& boundingBox, double& dist) const;

    // Compute an axis-aligned bounding box from a set of vertices
    void computeAxisAlignedBox(std::vector<Vertex>& vertices);

    // Compute an oriented bounding box using principal component analysis from a set of vertices
    void computeOrientedBox(std::vector<Vertex>& vertices);

    // Member variables
    Eigen::Vector3d min;
    Eigen::Vector3d max;
    Eigen::Vector3d extent;
    std::vector<Eigen::Vector3d> orientedPoints;
    std::string type;
};
```



**System Flow Description**:

In the OrientMesh workflow, everything begins with the user providing 3D object
data in the form of a `.obj` file, which encapsulates information about vertices,
edges, and faces. Initially, this data is ingested and stored by the
`Mesh` class into specialized C++ data structures. Throughout this
process, we leverage the `Eigen` library[^4] for advanced linear
algebra operations, ensuring both robustness and efficiency.

After that, the parsed data from the `Mesh` class is passed onto the
`BoundingBox` class. Here, utilizing methodologies such as Principal Component
Analysis (PCA)[^5], the OBB is computed from the
provided mesh data more efficiently. The `BoundingBox` assesses the eigen
vectors of the object's distribution to determine a 3D box that minimally
encapsulates the object.

Upon completion of the OBB extraction, all data is amalgamated through the
`BoundingBox` class. Harnessing the power of pybind11 and PyQt, marrying the
efficiency of C++ with the flexibility of Python, this interface acts as a
bridge between C++ and Python, facilitating users to conveniently access and
utilize OBB data and its associated operations.

## Algorithm

### 3D Mesh Oriented Bounding Box (OBB) using PCA

1. **Extract vertex coordinates from the mesh**:

  ```math
  \mathbf{p}_i, \quad i = 1, 2, \ldots, N
  ```

2. **Compute the mean of the vertex coordinates**:

  ```math
  \mathbf{m} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{p}_i
  ```

3. **Center the vertex coordinates**:

  ```math
  \mathbf{q}_i = \mathbf{p}_i - \mathbf{m}
  ```

4. **Compute the covariance matrix**:

  ```math
  \mathbf{C} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{q}_i \mathbf{q}_i^T
  ```

5. **Decompose the covariance matrix to get the principal directions**:

  ```math
  \mathbf{C} \mathbf{v}_j = \lambda_j \mathbf{v}_j
  ```

  <p align="center">
    where $\mathbf{v}_j$ are the eigenvectors (principal directions) and
    $lambda_j$ are the eigenvalues of $\mathbf{C}$.
  </p>

6. **Project vertices onto the principal directions to get the dimensions of the OBB**:

  ```math
  D_j = \max_{i} (\mathbf{p}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_j) - \min_{i} (\mathbf{p}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_j), \quad j = 1, 2, 3
  ```

  <p align="center">
   where $D_1, D_2, D_3$ represent the dimensions ($L, W, H$ ) respectively.
